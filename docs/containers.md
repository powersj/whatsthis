For the initial development of the app, platforms were limited to those that
could easily be tested. The are some additional container run-times that could
be added at a later date:

* `bottlerocket`
* `rkt`: however, per [GitHub page](https://github.com/rkt/rkt) no longer under
  development
* `openvz`: the commercial version, Virtuozzo is available, but otherwise
  development appears to have ended
